A subclass of UIAlertView where you can set your own size and you'll get an empty UIAlertView for adding your own custom UIViews. Usage:

    alert = [[PMCustomAlert alloc] initPopupWithWidth:320 andHeight:240];
    [alert show];

You can add your own UIViews to it using addSubview:.

You can use UIAlertView's own options, but they may not fit with the popup.
